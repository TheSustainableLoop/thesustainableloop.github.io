Title: About
---

My name is Mirjam Born and I am the founder of *The Sustainable Loop*.
I studied cultural studies and have worked a lot on production and supply chains
as well as textile seals in the clothing industry.
In doing so, I noticed repeatedly that on the one hand,
there is already a lot of research and approaches
for (more) sustainable production - but many results are not implemented in practice.
On the other hand, for many small and medium-sized companies,
it is not possible for cost reasons and due to low order volumes,
to source sustainable materials and to find regional and fair production conditions.
I would like to change that!

*The Sustainable Loop* aims to connect current research and companies
and thus make sustainable materials and fairer production processes
accessible for small and medium sized enterprises.
