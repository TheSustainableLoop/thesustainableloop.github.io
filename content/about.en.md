The **SuperCleanClothes** project offers advice and research on eco-sustainable topics with a special focus on eco-fair clothing production. Several years of research experience in the societal and political handling of the tension between conventional and eco-fair production form the basis for well-founded competences around certifications, seals, industry associations, NGOs, government initiatives and other related topics.
