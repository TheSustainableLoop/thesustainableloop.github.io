We would like to make it easier for small and medium-sized fashion labels
to access sustainable materials and production processes in the knitwear sector.

### Connecting research, innovation and SMEs.

Although there is already a lot of research and innovation
in the field of sustainable materials for textile production,
many small and medium-sized companies have difficulties
to use them in their production and supply chains.
Reasons for this are a lack of time or missing human and financial resources
to implement innovations.
Our goal is, through the bundled purchase of sustainable materials,
the knowledge of further processing and cooperation with research institutes,
to reduce the costs for the use of sustainable materials and production chains
and to strengthen communication between industry and research.

### Working together to build a transparent, eco-fair production chain

For us, sustainable production means taking into account the complete life cycle of the clothing we produce. That is why we source eco-fair produced yarns,
organize transparent production processes that are as local as possible, and take back the clothing we produce after the wear cycle,
to recycle them to a high quality or for composting. 
To achieve this goal, we work with various partners who support us with their expertise
and to combine individual projects into sustainable production.

### We are looking for:

Partners in the field of:

- Producers of recyclable yarn
- Knitting mills to test elasthane-free yarns and models
- Research projects on the topic of recyclable clothing or high-quality recycling of the textiles used.
- Fashion labels: You have a fashion label or would like to produce knitwear?
  Then write to us at info@thesustainableloop.com and tell us
  what the biggest hurdles in production are for you and how we can help you.

*The Sustainable Loop* is a start-up in the pre-seed phase.
At the moment we are in the process of connecting the different production steps.
This project has already been funded by the Berlin Start-up Stipend.
