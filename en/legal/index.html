Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Furthermore, should more specific legal bases be decisive in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.</p><ul><li><strong>Contract performance and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b. GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, or for the performance of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject&rsquo;s request.</li><li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b. GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party, unless such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data.</li></ul><p>In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Act on Protection against Misuse of personal data during data processing (Federal Data Protection Act &ndash; BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for purposes (Section 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of employees. In addition, the data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p><h2 id=m27>Security measures</h2><p>We make decisions in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure an appropriate level of protection.</p><p>The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, transfer, safeguarding of availability and its separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects&rsquo; rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data compromise. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and processes in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.</p><p>SSL encryption (https): To protect your data transmitted via our online offer, we use SSL encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix <code>https://</code> in the address bar of your browser.</p><h2 id=m25>Transmission of personal data</h2><p>In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to or disclosed to other bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons. The recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.</p><h2 id=m24>Data processing in third countries</h2><p>If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities or companies, this will only be done in accordance with the legal requirements.</p><p>Subject to express consent or contractually or legally required transfer, we only process or have data processed in third countries with a recognized level of data protection, contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission, in the presence of certifications or binding internal data protection regulations (Art. 44 to 49 GDPR, <a href=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de rel=noopener target=_blank>information page of the EU Commission</a>).</p><h2 id=m12>Deletion of data</h2><p>The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal requirements as soon as their consents permitted for processing are revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data has ceased to apply or it is not required for the purpose). If the data are not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing will be limited to these purposes. That is, the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law or whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person.</p><p>Our data protection notices may also contain further details on the retention and deletion of data, which take priority for the respective processing operations.</p><h2 id=m225>Provision of the online offer and web hosting</h2><p>In order to provide our online offer securely and efficiently, we use the services of one or more web hosting providers from whose servers (or servers managed by them) the online offer can be accessed. For these purposes, we may use infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage space and database services, as well as security services and technical maintenance services.</p><p>The data processed as part of the provision of the hosting offer may include all information relating to the users of our online offer, which is generated as part of the use and communication. This regularly includes the IP address, which is necessary to be able to deliver the contents of online offers to browsers, and all entries made within our online offer or from websites.</p><ul><li><strong>Types of data processed:</strong> Content data (e.g. entries in online forms); usage data (e.g. web pages visited, interest in content, access times); meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).</li><li><strong>Data subjects:</strong> Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online services).</li><li><strong>Purposes of processing:</strong> Provision of our online offer and user-friendliness; information technology infrastructure (operation and provision of information systems and technical devices (computers, servers, etc.).); reach measurement (e.g. access statistics, recognition of returning visitors); conversion measurement (measurement of the effectiveness of marketing measures); server monitoring and error detection.</li><li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. GDPR).</li></ul><p><strong>Further notes on processing processes, procedures and services:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collection of access data and log files:</strong> We ourselves (or our web hosting provider) collect data on each access to the server (so-called server log files). The server log files may include the address and name of the web pages and files accessed, the date and time of access, data volumes transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user&rsquo;s operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider. The server log files may be used, on the one hand, for security purposes, e.g., to prevent server overload (especially in the event of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and, on the other hand, to ensure the utilization of the servers and their stability; Legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. GDPR); Deletion of data: Log file information is stored for a maximum period of 30 days and then deleted or anonymized. Data whose further storage is required for evidentiary purposes is exempt from deletion until final clarification of the respective incident.</li><li><strong>Content-Delivery-Network:</strong> We use a content delivery network (CDN). A CDN is a service with the help of which the content of an online offer, in particular large media files such as graphics or program scripts, can be delivered faster and more securely with the help of regionally distributed servers connected via the Internet; Legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. GDPR).</li><li><strong>GitHub:</strong> Services in the field of providing information technology infrastructure and related services (e.g., storage space and/or computing capacity); Service provider: GitHub B.V., Vijzelstraat 68-72, 1017 HL Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Legal Grounds: Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f.

GDPR), Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. GDPR).</li></ul><h2 id=m408>Surveys and polls</h2><p>We conduct surveys and interviews in order to collect information for the respective communicated survey or interview purpose. The surveys and questionnaires we conduct (hereinafter &ldquo;surveys&rdquo;) are evaluated anonymously. Personal data is only processed insofar as this is necessary for the provision and technical implementation of the surveys (e.g. processing of the IP address in order to display the survey in the user&rsquo;s browser or to enable the survey to be resumed with the aid of a cookie).</p><ul><li><strong>Types of data processed:</strong> Contact data (e.g. e-mail, phone numbers); content data (e.g. entries in online forms); usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times); meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).</li><li><strong>Data subjects:</strong> Communication partners; participants.</li><li><strong>Purposes of processing:</strong> Feedback (e.g., collecting feedback via an online form).</li><li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f.

This may result in risks for the users because, for example, it could make it more difficult to enforce the rights of the users.</p><p>Furthermore, user data is usually processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, usage profiles can be created based on the usage behavior and resulting interests of the users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the users&rsquo; computers, in which the usage behavior and interests of the users are stored. Furthermore, data independent of the devices used by the users may also be stored in the usage profiles (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).</p><p>For a detailed presentation of the respective forms of processing and the options to object (opt-out), we refer to the privacy statements and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.</p><p>In the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, we also point out that these can be asserted most effectively with the providers.

These can be, for example, graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as &ldquo;content&rdquo;).</p><p>The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the user, since without the IP address they could not send the content to their browser. The IP address is thus required for the display of this content or functionality. We strive to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP address only for the delivery of the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as &ldquo;web beacons&rdquo;) for statistical or marketing purposes.

arise in particular from Art. 15 to 21 GDPR:</p><ul><li><strong>Right to object:</strong> You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.

Many of the terms are taken from the law and defined primarily in Art. 4 of the GDPR. The legal definitions are binding. The following explanations, on the other hand, are primarily intended to aid understanding. The terms are sorted alphabetically.</p><ul><li><strong>Conversion measurement:</strong> Conversion measurement (also referred to as &ldquo;visit action evaluation&rdquo;) is a method used to determine the effectiveness of marketing measures. For this purpose, a cookie is usually stored on the users&rsquo; devices within the websites on which the marketing measures take place and then retrieved again on the target website. For example, this allows us to track whether the ads we have placed on other websites have been successful.</li><li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> &ldquo;Personal data&rdquo; means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter &ldquo;data subject&rdquo;); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g. cookie) or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</li><li><strong>Reach measurement:</strong> Reach measurement (also known as web analytics) is used to evaluate the flow of visitors to an online offering and can include visitors&rsquo; behavior or interests in certain information, such as website content. With the help of reach analysis, website owners can see, for example, at what time visitors visit their website and what content they are interested in. This enables them, for example, to better adapt the content of the website to the needs of their visitors.
