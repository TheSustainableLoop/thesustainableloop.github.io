to access sustainable materials and production processes in the knitwear sector.</p><h3 id=connecting-research-innovation-and-small-businesses>Connecting research, innovation and small businesses</h3><p>Although there is already a lot of research and innovation
in the field of sustainable materials for textile production,
many small and medium-sized companies have difficulties
to use them in their production and supply chains.
Reasons for this are a lack of time or missing human and financial resources
to implement innovations.
Our goal is, through the bundled purchase of sustainable materials,
the knowledge of further processing and cooperation with research institutes,
to reduce the costs for the use of sustainable materials and production chains
and to strengthen communication between industry and research.</p><h3 id=working-together-to-build-a-transparent-eco-fair-production-chain>Working together to build a transparent, eco-fair production chain</h3><p>For us, sustainable production means taking into account the complete life cycle of the clothing we produce. That is why we source eco-fair produced yarns,
organize transparent production processes that are as local as possible, and take back the clothing we produce after the wear cycle,
to recycle them to a high quality or for composting.
To achieve this goal, we work with various partners who support us with their expertise
and to combine individual projects into sustainable production.</p><h3 id=we-are-looking-for>We are looking for:</h3><p>Partners in the field of:</p><ul><li>Producers of recyclable yarn</li><li>Knitting mills to test elasthane-free yarns and models</li><li>Research projects on the topic of recyclable clothing or high-quality recycling of the textiles used.</li><li>Fashion labels: You have a fashion label or would like to produce knitwear?
Then write to us at <a href=mailto:info@thesustainableloop.com>info@thesustainableloop.com</a> and tell us
what the biggest hurdles in production are for you and how we can help you.</li></ul><p><em>The Sustainable Loop</em> is a start-up in the pre-seed phase.
At the moment we are in the process of connecting the different production steps.
This project has already been funded by the Berlin Start-up Stipend.</p></article><article id=about><h2 class=major>About</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><p>My name is Mirjam Born and I am the founder of <em>The Sustainable Loop</em>.
I studied cultural studies and have worked a lot on production and supply chains
as well as textile seals in the clothing industry.
In doing so, I noticed repeatedly that on the one hand,
there is already a lot of research and approaches
for (more) sustainable production - but many results are not implemented in practice.
On the other hand, for many small and medium-sized companies,
it is not possible for cost reasons and due to low order volumes,
to source sustainable materials and to find regional and fair production conditions.
I would like to change that!</p><p><em>The Sustainable Loop</em> aims to connect current research and companies
and thus make sustainable materials and fairer production processes
accessible for small and medium sized enterprises.</p></article></div><div id=language style=margin-top:2em;font-size:.7rem><a href=https://thesustainableloop.com/de/ style="border:0;padding:0 .2em;letter-spacing:.2rem">Deutsch</a></div><footer id=footer><p class=copyright style=font-size:.8rem>Supported by:
